Where To Code
================
Where to Code is a layout of places to for coders to code in Austin - curated by developers for developers.

A live version of this will be up as soon as I deploy.

Description
-----------
As a developer in Austin, I've found it challenging to find _good_ information on public places to code (coffee shops, co-working spaces, libraries, ect.). So I've set out to do something about that.

Also, as a budding developer, this is a project for me to learn/practice writing code using TDD - [test driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
