Where To Code
================
Where to Code is a layout of places to for coders to code in Austin - curated by developers for developers. A live version of this will be up as soon as I deploy.

Description
-----------
As a developer in Austin, I found it challenging to find _good_ information on public places to code (coffee shops, co-working spaces, libraries, ect.). So I have set out to do something about that. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:bmart35@gmail.com) if you would like to get involved as well.

Also, as a _budding developer_, this is a project for me to learn/practice writing code using TDD - [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

How it works
-----------
Users can sign up, and search through an index of places in Austin where they can code. For each place there will be a map for directions, hours, and a basic description. They can also see what other coders have to say about each particular location.

For each place, a user can give it an **upvote** or a **downvote** and/or leave an **opinion** about it. At anytime they can change their vote, and opinion, but each user only has one opinion and vote per place, so after it is initially made, they can only update it.

Opinions are restricted to 160 characters like a tweet. They are designed to be brief and to-the-point rather than reviews. This allows for other users to read through them quickly when trying to gather info.

This is designed to allow general opinions on places for developers to code change quickly (as management/strategies for small businesses can change quickly) - and not to let potential old review "baggage" hold the business down (or sometimes up - making businesses have to keep **earning** the business).
