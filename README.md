Where To Code
================
Where to Code is a layout of places to for coders to code in Austin - curated by developers for developers. A live version of this will be up as soon as I deploy.

Description
-----------
As a developer in Austin, I found it challenging to find _good_ information on public places to code (coffee shops, co-working spaces, libraries, ect.). So I have set out to do something about that. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:bmart35@gmail.com) if you would like to get involved as well.

Also, as a _budding developer_, this is a project for me to learn/practice writing code using TDD - [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

How it works
-----------
Coders can search through an index of places in Austin where they can code. Each place has a map for directions, hours, and a description. They can also see what other coders have to say about each particular location.

At this point, coders can signup to get involved as well.

Per place, a coder can give an **upvote** or a **downvote** and/or leave an **opinion** about it, either of which they can be changed at anytime. Each coder only has one opinion and vote per place, so after it is initially made, it can only be updated.

Opinions are restricted to 160 characters - like a tweet. They are meant to be **brief opinions** rather than **full reviews**, allowing for other coders to scan through them quickly to gather info.

This is designed to allow general opinions on places to change quickly (as management/strategies for small businesses often changes quickly) - and not for old review "baggage" to _hold the business down_ (and in some cases, _hold it up_ - making it necessary to keep **earning** the business).
