Where To Code
================
Where to Code is a layout of places to for coders to code in Austin - curated by developers for developers.

A live version of this will be up as soon as I deploy.

Description
-----------
As a developer in Austin, I found it challenging to find _good_ information on public places to code (coffee shops, co-working spaces, libraries, ect.). So I have set out to do something about that. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:bmart35@gmail.com) if you would like to get involved as well.

Also, as a _budding developer_, this is a project for me to learn/practice writing code using TDD - [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
